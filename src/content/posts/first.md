Bam we're finally here!

I'm Jakob, I love building applications. That's pretty much all, I am starting to put out my work so this blog is for the long form things I can write.

First off, I love react, specifically nextjs and the surrounding tools, although this site was built with astro (lol) nextjs allows me to move fast.

There'll be more coming soon, trust.

Thank you for reading

-Jakob
